SplitPipeline Release Notes
===========================

## v0.1.0

New parameter Auto is used in order to select Load values automatically during
processing. Use Verbose in order to view some related information. Yet another
new parameter Cost is used together with Auto; it is not needed in most cases
and introduced rather for experiments.

## v0.0.1

This is the first of v0 series (pre-release versions). Cmdlet parameters and
behaviour may change.

The cmdlet Split-Pipeline passes simple tests and shows good performance gain
in a few practical scenarios.

Failures, errors, warnings, and verbose messages from parallel pipelines are
trivial, straightforward, and perhaps not useful enough for troubleshooting.
