SplitPipeline Release Notes
===========================

## v0.0.1

This is the pre-release version. Cmdlet parameters and behaviour may change.

The cmdlet Split-Pipeline passes simple tests and shows good performance gain
in a few practical scenarios.

Failures, errors, warnings, and verbose messages from parallel pipelines are
trivial, straightforward, and perhaps not useful enough for troubleshooting.
