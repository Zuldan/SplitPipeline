SHORT DESCRIPTION
    SplitPipeline - Parallel Data Processing in PowerShell

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The only cmdlet is Split-Pipeline. It splits the input, processes parts by
    parallel pipelines, and joins the output that may be processed directly.
    It works without collecting the entire input which may be even infinite.
